## Stacks for Windows and GNU/Linux **(WORK-IN-PROGRESS)**

Python implementation of macOS' stack feature that groups files
from your desktop into folder by formats. This script should work
on every OS that is able to run python scripts and have desktop folder
in ```~/Desktop``` *(even on macOS lmao)*

* Write unstack function
