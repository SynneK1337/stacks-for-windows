## Stacks for Windows and GNU/Linux **(WORK-IN-PROGRESS)**

Python implementation of macOS' ```stacks``` feature that groups files
from your desktop into folder by formats. This script should work
on every OS that is able to run python scripts and have desktop folder
in ```~/Desktop``` *(even on macOS lmao)*

![Example](/media/example.gif)

## Requirements
* python 3.4 or later

## Usage
* ```python stacks.py --stack``` to stack files.
* ```python stacks.py --unstack``` to unstack files.
* To make life easier, create a new folder in your user folder and add the bat files. Then, add the folder to PATH so you can use cmd to edit anytime you want. :D
* Soon, I'll see if I can make a toggle file in batch to add to regedit so you can add it to the right click menu bar. 

## Special thanks to
