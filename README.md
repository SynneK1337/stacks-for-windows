## Stacks for Windows and GNU/Linux **(WORK-IN-PROGRESS)**

Python implementation of macOS' ```stacks``` feature that groups files
from your desktop into folder by formats. This script should work
on every OS that is able to run python scripts and have desktop folder
in ```~/Desktop``` *(even on macOS lmao)*

![Example](/media/example.gif)

## Requirements
* python 3.4 or later

## Usage
```python stacks.py```

## TODO
* Add more types of files
* Write unstack function

## Special thanks to
[disconnect3d](https://github.com/disconnect3d) for giving me some tips about this script
